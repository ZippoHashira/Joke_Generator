# Joke Generator

This is a simple Python program (`jokes.py`) that generates random jokes using Python's `random` module from a list of jokes.

## How to use:

To run the joke generator program:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the `jokes.py` file to your local machine.
3. Open `jokes.py` in a Python editor or IDE of your choice.
4. Run to execute the program.
5. Each time you run the program, a random joke will be displayed on the console.

Feel free to modify the list of jokes in the `jokes.py` file to include your favorite jokes or expand the collection.

Have fun and enjoy the random jokes generated by the program!
